1. {}=> scope
2. for constant use only const and for variable use let only
3. prefered not to use var bcz of issues in block scope and functional scope  
4. javaScript is a safe language as without initialise the variable we can write
the variable name but not a prefered way but can be used  
5. if the value of the variable cant be defined so js considered it as undefined */
